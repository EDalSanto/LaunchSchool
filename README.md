# LaunchSchool
* Launch School embodies part of my path to becoming a professional developer.
* It espouses mastery-based learning, meaning that progress is contingent upon successful completions of previous projects. Understaning is fixed, while time is variable under this model. 
* This is contrary to traiditional time-based models where understanding is variable and time is fixed.
* The program begins with by teaching the fundamentals of back-end development via Ruby and covers vital topics such as HTTP, SQL and Relational Databases, and OOP. It then transtions to Front-End programming to master HTML, CSS, and Javascript. * 
* After a foundation has been laid, the program moves on to teaching Frameworks(like Rails), Integrations, and Advanced Topics.
* Throughout the program, founder Chris Lee and staff give technical interviews to student to assert they're progressing and truly mastering the topic. 
* The end goal of this program is be a full-stack engineer who truly understands the underpinnings of the web, and not just how to use a specific framework.
