Artist Uses 3D Printing To Preserve Artifacts Destroyed By ISIS,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/4ldBbeC2urw/artist-uses-3d-printing-to-preserve-artifacts-destroyed-by-isis,"tedlistens writes: ""From the burning of the Library of Alexandria to the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan by the Taliban, to the Nazi's battle to burn as much ""degenerate art"" as they could find, mobs and soldiers have been quick to destroy what took societies centuries to create; what museums and collectors spent decades collecting, preserving, and documenting for the public."" However, as noted by Motherboard in an article to which tedlistens links, ""The digital era looks different: files can be cheaply hosted in data centers spread across several states or continents to ensure permanence. Morehshin Allahyari, an Iranian born artist, educator, and activist, wants to apply that duplicability to the artifacts that ISIS has destroyed. Now, Allahyari is working on digitally fabricating the sculptures for a series called ""Material Speculation"" as part of a residency in Autodesk's Pier 9 program. The first in the series is ""Material Speculation: ISIS,"" which, through intense research, is modeling and reproducing statues destroyed by ISIS in 2015. Allahyari isn't just interested in replicating lost objects but making it possible for anyone to do the same: Embedded within each semi-translucent copy is a flash drive with Allahyari's research about the artifacts, and an online version is coming.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Ask Slashdot: Best Test Case Manager Plugin For JIRA?,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/nSVwGS4ZXSk/ask-slashdot-best-test-case-manager-plugin-for-jira,"Bomarc writes: I've been working with software testing ... for a few years now. And there seems to be a serious lack of QA &mdash; Test Case Management (TCM) tools. The company that I'm working for needs a good test case manager. Currently JIRA is the tool of choice for other aspects of project management. I'm not asking to jump ship from JIRA, but the Atlassian TCM ""Zephyr"" has several problems, some of the key ones include: It does not have (any) matrix capabilities, no test case suite capabilities, if you change one test case (including assignments) the system changes all of the runs from that test case, the integration between the defect tracker and the TCM is archaic (at best), the number of actions to pass/fail a step (or test case) are annoying (way to many). Whoever designed it doesn't use it. If you watch the ""Introduction"" for Zephyr &ndash; it is amusing to see how the person performing he demo skips over and fumbles when dealing with the flaws I've mentioned above.

I have used the product ""TestLog"" which is a well-thought-out product; has test matrix capabilities (and other good features); however it does not have any integration with JIRA. (Hint, hint: Atlassian, this is what you need!). 

Is there any company that makes a ""plug-in"" for JIRA with a similar features to TestLog &ndash; test case management that is well thought out, not just an afterthought?<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The figure compiled by The Times, explains reporter Jerry Hirsch, comprises a variety of government incentives, including grants, tax breaks, factory construction, discounted loans and environmental credits that Tesla can sell. It also includes tax credits and rebates to buyers of solar panels and electric cars. ""He definitely goes where there is government money,"" said an equity research analyst. ""Musk and his companies' investors enjoy most of the financial upside of the government support, while taxpayers shoulder the cost,"" Hirsch adds. ""The payoff for the public would come in the form of major pollution reductions, but only if solar panels and electric cars break through as viable mass-market products. For now, both remain niche products for mostly well-heeled customers."" And as Musk moves into a new industry &mdash; battery-based home energy storage &mdash; Hirsch notes Tesla has already secured a commitment of $126 million in California subsidies to companies developing energy storage technology.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

MESSENGER Completes Second Burn to Maintain Mercury Orbit (Universe Today),http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/398957472?client_source=api&format=json,"A little over a week before NASA's MAVEN spacecraft fired its rockets to
successfully enter orbit around Mars, MESSENGER performed a little burn of its

MinGW and MSVCRT Conflict Causes Floating-Point Value Corruption,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/hGBrBWP6QT4/mingw-and-msvcrt-conflict-causes-floating-point-value-corruption,"jones_supa writes: If you are working on a C++ program where you need very accurate floating point numbers, you might have decided to use long double data type for the extra precision. After a few calculations, you happen to print your number. To your shock, instead of the number being 123.456789, it is printed out as -6.518427 &#215; 10^264 (or 2.745563 depending on your computer). This is actually a bug in some versions of MinGW g++ 4.8.1 (MinGW is a port of GNU programming tools for Windows). Microsoft's C++ runtime library reserves 80 bits for double and long double. When MinGW uses the Microsoft DLL to print out the value, the number is interpreted as using only 64 bits. This discrepancy causes garbage results to be output.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The computer was apparently inside boxes of electronics that she had cleaned out from her garage after her husband died. This would be nothing unusual, except that the recycled computer was an Apple I,. The recycling firm eventually sold the Apple I for $200,000 to a private collection, and because the company gives 50 per cent of the proceeds from sold items back to the original owner, they wish to split the proceeds with the mystery donor.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Scientists Study Crime In Progress In a VR Simulated Environment,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/G6oKqPHKye0/scientists-study-crime-in-progress-in-a-vr-simulated-environment,"HughPickens.com writes: Claire Nee writes in the NYT that for psychologists, it's best to observe actual behavior, in real time, and afterward interview research participants. Yet for obvious ethical and safety reasons, it's almost never possible to observe a crime as it happens. Now psychologists have devised a simulated environment that can be navigated using a mouse or a game controller. and had willing, experienced ex-burglars to commit a mock burglary in it. Ex-burglars approached the task in a dramatically different way from a comparison group of postgraduate students, of a similar age as our experienced ex-burglars. Burglars entered and exited the house at the rear, while students, unaware of the cover that the side and rear of the house afforded, entered at the exposed front. Burglars spent significantly more time in areas of the house with high-value items and navigated it much more systematically than the students did. They also showed greater discernment, by stealing fewer but more valuable items. Most important, all participants burgled the real and the simulated houses almost identically (PDF). We concluded that using simulations can be a robust way to study crime, and in studying it this way, we will not be limited to just burglary. ""A better understanding of criminal behavior will help us reduce opportunities for crime in our neighborhoods,"" concludes Nee. ""By knowing what the burglar is looking for &mdash; what signals wealth, occupancy, ease of access and security in properties &mdash; we can make adjustments in awareness and protection.""<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
