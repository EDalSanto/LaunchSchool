# Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years.

# puts "How old are you?"
# age = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "In 10 years you will be: #{age+10}"
# puts "In 20 years you will be: #{age+20}"
# puts "In 30 years you will be: #{age+30}"
