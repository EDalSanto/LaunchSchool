how to work with a coding problem

- don't underestimate; resist the urge to dive into code
- read description 3 times; product an outline if necessary
- communicate and clarify; ask about any ambiguity 
- test cases (happy paths, fail paths, edge cases)
- have a plan (algo), and verify with that
- manage your energy
- abstraction; load one thing at a time into your head
